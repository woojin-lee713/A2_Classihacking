    "Standardization means that we have to compute the mean and the standard deviation of the data. We take the values of the column, subtract the mean of the values, and divide it by the standard deviation of the values. The mean and the SD is calculated through computing the whole data set. We need to test if the preformance of our model is any good. You should never look into the test dataset becuase by looking into the test data set, it is like cheating. Looking at the test, you are going to be overly optimistic about the acutal data set. If we do anything with the total mean or standard deviation of the entire data set, we are cheating and looking into the test data set. When we apply it separetly, we ensure that the scale of each dataset is consistent and does not bring in any bias or distortion. By applying it collectively, we can skew the analysis or modeling process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purity of the training data, if we standardize using the entire dataset, may cause data leakage. By puting everything on one scale, we allow the machine learning toolto compute better logistical regressions or tree scales. By completing two seperate standardizations on two sets separetly, we also create a much easier environment to comprehend and analyze different data sets to make better business decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "By applying standardization seperately, we ensure the purity of each data within the set. This ensures that we accurately analyze each data set by modeling and preserving the original characteristics or meaning of the data when we scale them accordingly. This ofcourse avoids biases introduced when creating different scales."

    "\n",
    "Just like in a ROC curve, we go down the sorted (by score or probability) list of samples. We one-by-one add an additional sample to our positive samples, noting down the attendant classifier's TPR and FPR and threshold. We now also note down the percentage of our list of samples predicted as positive. Remember we start from the mostest positive, where the percentage labelled as positive would be minuscule, like 0.1 or so and the threshold like a 0.99 in probability or so. As we decrease the threshold, the percentage predicted to be positive clearly increases until everything is predicted positive at a threshold of 0. What we now do is, at each such additional sample/threshold (given to us by the `roc_curve` function from `sklearn`), we calculate the expected profit per person and plot it against the percentage predicted positive by that threshold to produce a profit curve. Thus, small percentages correspond to samples most likely to be positive: a percentage of 8% means the top 8% of our samples ranked by likelihood of being positive.\n",
