    "Standardization means that we have to compute the mean and the standard deviation of the data. We take the values of the column, subtract the mean of the values, and divide it by the standard deviation of the values. The mean and the SD is calculated through computing the whole data set. We need to test if the preformance of our model is any good. You should never look into the test dataset becuase by looking into the test data set, it is like cheating. Looking at the test, you are going to be overly optimistic about the acutal data set. If we do anything with the total mean or standard deviation of the entire data set, we are cheating and looking into the test data set. When we apply it separetly, we ensure that the scale of each dataset is consistent and does not bring in any bias or distortion. By applying it collectively, we can skew the analysis or modeling process. \n",
    "\n",
    "The purity of the training data, if we standardize using the entire dataset, may cause data leakage. By puting everything on one scale, we allow the machine learning toolto compute better logistical regressions or tree scales. By completing two seperate standardizations on two sets separetly, we also create a much easier environment to comprehend and analyze different data sets to make better business decisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, variables may vary vastly depending on different scales and when standardizing them as a general, we can affect the performance of certain machine learning algorithms. By applying standardization seperately, we ensure the purity of each data within the set while also making sure that the model preforms better. In addition to that, standardizing variables separetely can help transform and preprocess variables in way that can ensures accurate and more precise analysis. By doing so, we accurately analyze each data set by modeling and preserving the original characteristics or meaning of the data when we scale them accordingly. This ofcourse avoids biases introduced when creating different scales."

Then a mask is created with ones for the training set indicies and zeros for the test indicies which are then with a boolean set from True to 1 (as train) and from False to 0 (as test). Then we apply the mask to the original dataframe by selecting rows from the original dataset, creating seperate training and test sets. All this process is initialized in begining with the random_state of 1983 so that other users generate the same output using what you have done.\n",

    "Overall, we created the mask with the same length as the number of rows of the dataFrame dftouse. Indices corresponding with the training set ('itrain') are set to integer 1 while indices corresponding with the test set ('itest') are set to 0 on the mask array. The mask array is then converted to a boolean array where the True indicates the data sets for train while the False corresponds with test data sets. Finally, the mask array is used to navigate through the dataframe to select rows corresponding with the True values, setting them as training set variables. Same applies when the dftest is corresponded with False values in the mask array, setting them to the test set. Therefore, the mask array acts as a selector for the data in the training and test sets. To ensure every user running this test ends with the same results, the random_state = 1983 was set (as a unique key of randomly assigned 70% train variables and 30% test sets). This approach ensures the data is split into mutually exclusive test and training sets while also maintaining the original order of the data in the global data frame."

We one-by-one add an additional sample to our positive samples, noting down the attendant classifier's TPR and FPR and threshold. We now also note down the percentage of our list of samples predicted as positive. Remember we start from the mostest positive, where the percentage labelled as positive would be minuscule, like 0.1 or so and the threshold like a 0.99 in probability or so. As we decrease the threshold, the percentage predicted to be positive clearly increases until everything is predicted positive at a threshold of 0. What we now do is, at each such additional sample/threshold (given to us by the `roc_curve` function from `sklearn`), we calculate the expected profit per person and plot it against the percentage predicted positive by that threshold to produce a profit curve. Thus, small percentages correspond to samples most likely to be positive: a percentage of 8% means the top 8% of our samples ranked by likelihood of being positive.\n",
